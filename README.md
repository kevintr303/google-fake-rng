(*Totally legit, nothing to see here... move along.*)  

Ever wanted to **win an argument with undeniable "random" proof**?  
Need to **convince your friends you're the luckiest person alive**?  
Or maybe just **prank someone into thinking the universe is on your side**?  

Well, my friend, **this is the tool for you.**  

## 🛠 What is this?  
This is a **fake** random number generator that *looks* real but always lands on your pre-selected numbers.  
It mimics **Google’s RNG search result page**, complete with a realistic UI, search bar, and even fake search results to make it *just believable enough*.  

### Features:
✅ **Preselect your "random" numbers** – Input specific numbers or ranges (e.g., `1,2-6,9`).  
✅ **Random or Sequential mode** – Either shuffle between your rigged numbers or cycle through them in order.  
✅ **Google-ish search results page** – Not *exactly* like Google, but close enough to fool your grandma.  
✅ **Smooth rolling animation** – Adds that dramatic effect before landing on your totally-not-rigged number.  
✅ **Pure evil fun.** 😈
